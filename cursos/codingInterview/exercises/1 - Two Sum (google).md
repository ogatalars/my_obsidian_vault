"Given an array of integers, return the indices of the two numbers that add up to a given target"

ex: [1,3,7,9,2]; target = 11; 
    0, 1, 2, 3, 4
return indices 3 e 4;

**STEP 1: Verify the constraints**
- Are all the numbers positive or can there be negatives?
- Are there duplicate numbers in the array?
- Will there always be a solotuin available?
- What do we return if there's no solution? (null?)
- Can there be multiple pairs that add up to the target?

**STEP 2: write out some tests cases (just differente combinations, tests to try)**
