**Destructuring in JavaScript and TypeScript**

Destructuring is a convenient way of extracting multiple values from data stored in objects and arrays. It allows you to unpack values from these structures into distinct variables.

### Destructuring in JavaScript

In JavaScript, destructuring can be used with both objects and arrays.

#### Object Destructuring

Here's an example:

```javascript
const wizard = { name: 'Gandalf', age: 3000, staff: true };

// Destructuring
const { name, age } = wizard;

console.log(name); // Output: Gandalf
console.log(age);  // Output: 3000
```

In this example, the `name` and `age` properties are extracted from the `wizard` object into variables of the same names.

#### Array Destructuring

Array destructuring works similarly:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

// Destructuring
const [first, second] = numbers;

console.log(first);  // Output: 1
console.log(second); // Output: 2
```

Here, `first` and `second` are assigned the first and second values of the `numbers` array, respectively.

### Destructuring in TypeScript

TypeScript adds a layer of type checking to destructuring, enhancing its safety and utility in typed contexts.

#### Object Destructuring with Types

```typescript
interface Wizard {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  staff: boolean;
}

const wizard: Wizard = { name: 'Gandalf', age: 3000, staff: true };

// Destructuring with type annotations
const { name, age }: { name: string; age: number } = wizard;

console.log(name); // Output: Gandalf
console.log(age);  // Output: 3000
```

In this TypeScript example, we define a `Wizard` interface to type-check our `wizard` object, and then use destructuring with type annotations.

#### Array Destructuring with Types

Similar to objects, arrays can also be destructured with types in TypeScript:

```typescript
const numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];

// Destructuring with type annotations
const [first, second]: [number, number] = numbers;

console.log(first);  // Output: 1
console.log(second); // Output: 2
```

In both JavaScript and TypeScript, destructuring can greatly simplify your code, making it more readable and concise.
