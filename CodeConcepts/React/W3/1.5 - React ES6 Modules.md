## Modules

JavaScript modules allow you to break up your code into separate files.

This makes it easier to maintain the code-base.

ES Modules rely on the `import` and `export` statements.

___

## Export

You can export a function or variable from any file.

Let us create a file named `person.js`, and fill it with the things we want to export.

There are two types of exports: Named and Default.

___

## Named Exports

You can create named exports two ways. In-line individually, or all at once at the bottom.

### Example[Get your own React.js Server](https://www.w3schools.com/spaces/ "W3Schools Spaces")

In-line individually:

`person.js`

    export const name = "Jesse"
    export const age = 40
    

### All at once at the bottom:

`person.js`

    const name = "Jesse"
    const age = 40
    
    export { name, age }

## Default Exports

Let us create another file, named `message.js`, and use it for demonstrating default export.

You can only have one default export in a file.

### Example[Get your own React.js Server](https://www.w3schools.com/spaces/ "W3Schools Spaces")

`message.js`

    const message = () => {
      const name = "Jesse";
      const age = 40;
      return name + ' is ' + age + 'years old.';
    };
    
    export default message;
    

___

## Import

You can import modules into a file in two ways, based on if they are named exports or default exports.

Named exports must be destructured using curly braces. Default exports do not.
