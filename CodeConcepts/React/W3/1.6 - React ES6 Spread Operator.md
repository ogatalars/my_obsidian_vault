## Spread Operator

The JavaScript spread operator (`...`) allows us to quickly copy all or part of an existing array or object into another array or object.

The spread operator is often used in combination with destructuring.

We can use the spread operator with objects too:

### Example[Get your own React.js Server](https://www.w3schools.com/spaces/ "W3Schools Spaces")

Combine these two objects:

    const myVehicle = {
      brand: 'Ford',
      model: 'Mustang',
      color: 'red'
    }
    
    const updateMyVehicle = {
      type: 'car',
      year: 2021, 
      color: 'yellow'
    }
    
    const myUpdatedVehicle = {...myVehicle, ...updateMyVehicle}

Notice the properties that did not match were combined, but the property that did match, `color`, was overwritten by the last object that was passed, `updateMyVehicle`. The resulting color is now yellow.

Use the spread operator to combine the following arrays.

```
const arrayOne = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
const arrayTwo = [1, 2, 3];
const arraysCombined = [];

```
