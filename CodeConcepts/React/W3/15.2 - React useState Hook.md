The React `useState` Hook allows us to track state in a function component.

State generally refers to data or properties that need to be tracking in an application.

___

## Import `useState`

To use the `useState` Hook, we first need to `import` it into our component.

Notice that we are destructuring `useState` from `react` as it is a named export.

To learn more about destructuring, check out the [ES6 section](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_es6.asp).

___

## Initialize `useState`

We initialize our state by calling `useState` in our function component.

`useState` accepts an initial state and returns two values:

-   The current state.
-   A function that updates the state.

### Example:[Get your own React.js Server](https://www.w3schools.com/spaces/ "W3Schools Spaces")

Initialize state at the top of the function component.

    import { useState } from "react";
    
    function FavoriteColor() {
      const [color, setColor] = useState("");
    }
    

Notice that again, we are destructuring the returned values from `useState`.

The first value, `color`, is our current state.

The second value, `setColor`, is the function that is used to update our state.

These names are variables that can be named anything you would like.

Lastly, we set the initial state to an empty string: `useState("")`

## Read State

We can now include our state anywhere in our component.

### Example:[Get your own React.js Server](https://www.w3schools.com/spaces/ "W3Schools Spaces")

Use the state variable in the rendered component.

    import { useState } from "react";
    import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
    
    function FavoriteColor() {
      const [color, setColor] = useState("red");
    
      return <h1>My favorite color is {color}!</h1>
    }
    
    const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
    root.render(<FavoriteColor />);

___

## Update State

To update our state, we use our state updater function.

We should never directly update state. Ex: `color = "red"` is not allowed.

### Example:[Get your own React.js Server](https://www.w3schools.com/spaces/ "W3Schools Spaces")

Use a button to update the state:

    import { useState } from "react";
    import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
    
    function FavoriteColor() {
      const [color, setColor] = useState("red");
    
      return (
        <>
          <h1>My favorite color is {color}!</h1>
          <button
            type="button"
            onClick={() => setColor("blue")}
          >Blue</button>
        </>
      )
    }
    
    const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
    root.render(<FavoriteColor />);

## What Can State Hold

The `useState` Hook can be used to keep track of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, and any combination of these!

We could create multiple state Hooks to track individual values.

### Example:[Get your own React.js Server](https://www.w3schools.com/spaces/ "W3Schools Spaces")

Create multiple state Hooks:

    import { useState } from "react";
    import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
    
    function Car() {
      const [brand, setBrand] = useState("Ford");
      const [model, setModel] = useState("Mustang");
      const [year, setYear] = useState("1964");
      const [color, setColor] = useState("red");
    
      return (
        <>
          <h1>My {brand}</h1>
          <p>
            It is a {color} {model} from {year}.
          </p>
        </>
      )
    }
    
    const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
    root.render(<Car />);
    

[Run Example »](https://www.w3schools.com/react/showreact.asp?filename=demo2_react_usestate2)

Or, we can just use one state and include an object instead!

### Example:[Get your own React.js Server](https://www.w3schools.com/spaces/ "W3Schools Spaces")

Create a single Hook that holds an object:

    import { useState } from "react";
    import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
    
    function Car() {
      const [car, setCar] = useState({
        brand: "Ford",
        model: "Mustang",
        year: "1964",
        color: "red"
      });
    
      return (
        <>
          <h1>My {car.brand}</h1>
          <p>
            It is a {car.color} {car.model} from {car.year}.
          </p>
        </>
      )
    }
    
    const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
    root.render(<Car />);
    

[Run Example »](https://www.w3schools.com/react/showreact.asp?filename=demo2_react_usestate5)

Since we are now tracking a single object, we need to reference that object and then the property of that object when rendering the component. (Ex: `car.brand`)

___

## Updating Objects and Arrays in State

When state is updated, the entire state gets overwritten.

What if we only want to update the color of our car?

If we only called `setCar({color: "blue"})`, this would remove the brand, model, and year from our state.

We can use the JavaScript spread operator to help us.

### Example:[Get your own React.js Server](https://www.w3schools.com/spaces/ "W3Schools Spaces")

Use the JavaScript spread operator to update only the color of the car:

    import { useState } from "react";
    import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
    
    function Car() {
      const [car, setCar] = useState({
        brand: "Ford",
        model: "Mustang",
        year: "1964",
        color: "red"
      });
    
      const updateColor = () => {
        setCar(previousState => {
          return { ...previousState, color: "blue" }
        });
      }
    
      return (
        <>
          <h1>My {car.brand}</h1>
          <p>
            It is a {car.color} {car.model} from {car.year}.
          </p>
          <button
            type="button"
            onClick={updateColor}
          >Blue</button>
        </>
      )
    }
    
    const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
    root.render(<Car />);
    

[Run Example »](https://www.w3schools.com/react/showreact.asp?filename=demo2_react_usestate4)

Because we need the current value of state, we pass a function into our `setCar` function. This function receives the previous value.

We then return an object, spreading the `previousState` and overwriting only the color.
