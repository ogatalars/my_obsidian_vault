## Variables

Before ES6 there was only one way of defining your variables: with the `var` keyword. If you did not define them, they would be assigned to the global object. Unless you were in strict mode, then you would get an error if your variables were undefined.

Now, with ES6, there are three ways of defining your variables: `var`, `let`, and `const`.

If you use `var` outside of a function, it belongs to the global scope.

If you use `var` inside of a function, it belongs to that function.

If you use `var` inside of a block, i.e. a for loop, the variable is still available outside of that block.

`var` has a _function_ scope, not a _block_ scope.

`let` is the block scoped version of `var`, and is limited to the block (or expression) where it is defined.

If you use `let` inside of a block, i.e. a for loop, the variable is only available inside of that loop.

`let` has a _block_ scope.

`const` is a variable that once it has been created, its value can never change.

`const` has a _block_ scope.

The keyword `const` is a bit misleading.

It does not define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value.

Because of this you can NOT:

-   Reassign a constant value
-   Reassign a constant array
-   Reassign a constant object

But you CAN:

-   Change the elements of constant array
-   Change the properties of constant object
