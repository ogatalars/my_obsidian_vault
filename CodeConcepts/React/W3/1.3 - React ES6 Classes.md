## Classes

ES6 introduced classes.

A class is a type of function, but instead of using the keyword `function` to initiate it, we use the keyword `class`, and the properties are assigned inside a `constructor()` method.

Notice the case of the class name. We have begun the name, "Car", with an uppercase character. This is a standard naming convention for classes.

Now you can create objects using the Car class:

**Note:** The constructor function is called automatically when the object is initialized.

## Method in Classes

You can add your own methods in a class:

### Example[Get your own React.js Server](https://www.w3schools.com/spaces/ "W3Schools Spaces")

Create a method named "present":

    class Car {
      constructor(name) {
        this.brand = name;
      }
      
      present() {
        return 'I have a ' + this.brand;
      }
    }
    
    const mycar = new Car("Ford");
    mycar.present();

As you can see in the example above, you call the method by referring to the object's method name followed by parentheses (parameters would go inside the parentheses).

## Class Inheritance

To create a class inheritance, use the `extends` keyword.

A class created with a class inheritance inherits all the methods from another class:

### Example[Get your own React.js Server](https://www.w3schools.com/spaces/ "W3Schools Spaces")

Create a class named "Model" which will inherit the methods from the "Car" class:

    class Car {
      constructor(name) {
        this.brand = name;
      }
    
      present() {
        return 'I have a ' + this.brand;
      }
    }
    
    class Model extends Car {
      constructor(name, mod) {
        super(name);
        this.model = mod;
      }  
      show() {
          return this.present() + ', it is a ' + this.model
      }
    }
    const mycar = new Model("Ford", "Mustang");
    mycar.show();

The `super()` method refers to the parent class.

By calling the `super()` method in the constructor method, we call the parent's constructor method and get access to the parent's properties and methods.
