## Create React App

To learn and test React, you should set up a React Environment on your computer.

This tutorial uses the `create-react-app`.

The `create-react-app` tool is an officially supported way to create React applications.

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is required to use `create-react-app`.

Open your terminal in the directory you would like to create your application.

Run this command to create a React application named `my-react-app`:

npx create-react-app my-react-app

`create-react-app` will set up everything you need to run a React application.

**Note:** If you've previously installed `create-react-app` globally, it is recommended that you uninstall the package to ensure npx always uses the latest version of `create-react-app`. To uninstall, run this command: `npm uninstall -g create-react-app`.

___

## Run the React Application

Run this command to move to the `my-react-app` directory:

Run this command to execute the React application `my-react-app`:

A new browser window will pop up with your newly created React App! If not, open your browser and type `localhost:3000` in the address bar.

The result:
