## Operators

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

In the example below, we use the `+` **operator** to add together two values:

Although the `+` operator is often used to add together two values, like in the example above, it can also be used to add together a variable and a value, or a variable and another variable:

### Example

    int sum1 = 100 + 50;        // 150 (100 + 50)
    int sum2 = sum1 + 250;      // 400 (150 + 250)
    int sum3 = sum2 + sum2;     // 800 (400 + 400)
