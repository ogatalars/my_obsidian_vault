## Constants

If you don't want others (or yourself) to overwrite existing values, you can add the `const` keyword in front of the variable type.

This will declare the variable as "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only:

The `const` keyword is useful when you want a variable to always store the same value, so that others (or yourself) won't mess up your code. An example that is often referred to as a constant, is PI (3.14159...).

**Note:** You cannot declare a constant variable without assigning the value. If you do, an error will occur: A const field requires a value to be provided.
