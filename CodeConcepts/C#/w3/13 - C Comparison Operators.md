## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values (or variables). This is important in programming, because it helps us to find answers and make decisions.

The return value of a comparison is either `True` or `False`. These values are known as _Boolean values_, and you will learn more about them in the [Booleans](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/cs_booleans.asp) and [If..Else](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/cs_conditions.asp) chapter.

In the following example, we use the **greater than operator** (`>`) to find out if 5 is greater than 3:

### Example[Get your own C# Server](https://www.w3schools.com/spaces/ "W3Schools Spaces")

    int x = 5;
    int y = 3;
    Console.WriteLine(x > y); // returns True because 5 is greater than 3
