## C# Identifiers

All C# **variables** must be **identified** with **unique names**.

These unique names are called **identifiers**.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

**Note:** It is recommended to use descriptive names in order to create understandable and maintainable code:

The general rules for naming variables are:

-   Names can contain letters, digits and the underscore character (\_)
-   Names must begin with a letter
-   Names should start with a lowercase letter and it cannot contain whitespace
-   Names are case sensitive ("myVar" and "myvar" are different variables)
-   Reserved words (like C# keywords, such as `int` or `double`) cannot be used as names
