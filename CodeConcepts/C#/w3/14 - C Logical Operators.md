## Logical Operators

As with [comparison operators](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/cs_operators_comparison.php), you can also test for `True` or `False` values with **logical operators**.

Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values:

| Operator | Name | Description | Example | Try it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| &&  | Logical and | Returns True if both statements are true | x < 5 &&  x < 10 | [Try it »](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/trycs.php?filename=demo_oper_logical1) |
| ||  | Logical or | Returns True if one of the statements is true | x < 5 || x < 4 | [Try it »](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/trycs.php?filename=demo_oper_logical2) |
| ! | Logical not | Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true | !(x < 5 && x < 10) | [Try it »](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/trycs.php?filename=demo_oper_logical3) |

You will learn more about comparison and logical operators in the [Booleans](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/cs_booleans.php) and [If...Else](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/cs_conditions.php) chapters.
