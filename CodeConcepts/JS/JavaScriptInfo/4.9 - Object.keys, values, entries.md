Let’s step away from the individual data structures and talk about the iterations over them.

In the previous chapter we saw methods `map.keys()`, `map.values()`, `map.entries()`.

These methods are generic, there is a common agreement to use them for data structures. If we ever create a data structure of our own, we should implement them too.

They are supported for:

-   `Map`
-   `Set`
-   `Array`

Plain objects also support similar methods, but the syntax is a bit different.

## [Object.keys, values, entries](https://javascript.info/keys-values-entries#object-keys-values-entries)

For plain objects, the following methods are available:

-   [Object.keys(obj)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys) – returns an array of keys.
-   [Object.values(obj)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/values) – returns an array of values.
-   [Object.entries(obj)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/entries) – returns an array of `[key, value]` pairs.

Please note the distinctions (compared to map for example):

|  | Map | Object |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Call syntax | `map.keys()` | `Object.keys(obj)`, but not `obj.keys()` |
| Returns | iterable | “real” Array |

The first difference is that we have to call `Object.keys(obj)`, and not `obj.keys()`.

Why so? The main reason is flexibility. Remember, objects are a base of all complex structures in JavaScript. So we may have an object of our own like `data` that implements its own `data.values()` method. And we still can call `Object.values(data)` on it.

The second difference is that `Object.*` methods return “real” array objects, not just an iterable. That’s mainly for historical reasons.

For instance:

```
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};
```

-   `Object.keys(user) = ["name", "age"]`
-   `Object.values(user) = ["John", 30]`
-   `Object.entries(user) = [ ["name","John"], ["age",30] ]`

Here’s an example of using `Object.values` to loop over property values:

```
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};

// loop over values
for (let value of Object.values(user)) {
  alert(value); // John, then 30
}
```

Object.keys/values/entries ignore symbolic properties

Just like a `for..in` loop, these methods ignore properties that use `Symbol(...)` as keys.

Usually that’s convenient. But if we want symbolic keys too, then there’s a separate method [Object.getOwnPropertySymbols](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/getOwnPropertySymbols) that returns an array of only symbolic keys. Also, there exist a method [Reflect.ownKeys(obj)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Reflect/ownKeys) that returns _all_ keys.

## [Transforming objects](https://javascript.info/keys-values-entries#transforming-objects)

Objects lack many methods that exist for arrays, e.g. `map`, `filter` and others.

If we’d like to apply them, then we can use `Object.entries` followed by `Object.fromEntries`:

1.  Use `Object.entries(obj)` to get an array of key/value pairs from `obj`.
2.  Use array methods on that array, e.g. `map`, to transform these key/value pairs.
3.  Use `Object.fromEntries(array)` on the resulting array to turn it back into an object.

For example, we have an object with prices, and would like to double them:

```
let prices = {
  banana: 1,
  orange: 2,
  meat: 4,
};

let doublePrices = Object.fromEntries(
  // convert prices to array, map each key/value pair into another pair
  // and then fromEntries gives back the object
  Object.entries(prices).map(entry => [entry[0], entry[1] * 2])
);

alert(doublePrices.meat); // 8
```

It may look difficult at first sight, but becomes easy to understand after you use it once or twice. We can make powerful chains of transforms this way.

## [Tasks](https://javascript.info/keys-values-entries#tasks)

importance: 5

There is a `salaries` object with arbitrary number of salaries.

Write the function `sumSalaries(salaries)` that returns the sum of all salaries using `Object.values` and the `for..of` loop.

If `salaries` is empty, then the result must be `0`.

For instance:

```
let salaries = {
  "John": 100,
  "Pete": 300,
  "Mary": 250
};

alert( sumSalaries(salaries) ); // 650
```

```
function sumSalaries(salaries) {

  let sum = 0;
  for (let salary of Object.values(salaries)) {
    sum += salary;
  }

  return sum; // 650
}

let salaries = {
  "John": 100,
  "Pete": 300,
  "Mary": 250
};

alert( sumSalaries(salaries) ); // 650
```

Or, optionally, we could also get the sum using `Object.values` and `reduce`:

```
// reduce loops over array of salaries,
// adding them up
// and returns the result
function sumSalaries(salaries) {
  return Object.values(salaries).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) // 650
}
```

importance: 5

Write a function `count(obj)` that returns the number of properties in the object:

```
let user = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30
};

alert( count(user) ); // 2
```

Try to make the code as short as possible.

P.S. Ignore symbolic properties, count only “regular” ones.
