There are three ways to install TypeScript:

1.  Install TypeScript as an NPM package on your local machine or in your project.
2.  Install TypeScript NuGet Package in your .NET or .NET Core project.
3.  Install TypeScript as a Plug-in in your IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

## Install TypeScript using NPM

NPM ([Node.js package manager](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/nodejs/what-is-node-package-manager)) is used to install the [TypeScript package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript) on your local machine or a project. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/nodejs/what-is-nodejs) install on your local machine. If you are using JavaScript frameworks for your application, then it is highly recommended to [install Node.js](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/nodejs/setup-nodejs-development-environment).

To install or update the latest version of TypeScript, open command prompt/terminal and type the following command:

npm install -g typescript

The above command will install TypeScript globally so that you can use it in any project. Check the installed version of TypeScript using the following command:

tsc -v

Execute the following command to install the TypeScript to your local project as dev dependency.

npm install typescript --save-dev

## Install TypeScript as NuGet Package

For .NET or .NET Core projects, TypeScript can be installed as a NuGet package in your project. The NuGet package [Microsoft.TypeScript.MSBuild](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.TypeScript.MSBuild/) is an MSBuild task for TypeScript, which will automatically compile all `.ts` files to `.js` files as per `tsconfig.json` configuration when you build your project.

To install the TypeScript NuGet package, open NuGet Package Manager by right-clicking on a project node, click `Manage NuGet Packages..`, and search for typescript in the `Browse` tab. It will list all the packages related to TypeScript. Select **Microsoft.TypeScript.MSBuild** and click on the Install button. This will install TypeScript in your local ASP.NET project.

### TypeScript Visual Studio Extension

If your project type does not support the NuGet packages, then you can use [TypeScript Visual Studio Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TypeScriptTeam.typescript-40). You can [find and install the extension in Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/finding-and-using-visual-studio-extensions) from Tools > Extensions and Updates menu.

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) comes with built-in support for TypeScript.

## Install TypeScript Plug-in in your IDE

You can install an IDE specific TypeScript package or plugin for your IDE.

A few examples of plugins for popular code editors are:

1.  [Atom-TypeScript](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript): a TypeScript language service for Atom developed by TypeStrong.
2.  [TypeScript IDE for Eclipse](https://github.com/angelozerr/typescript.java/wiki/Getting-Started): an Eclipse plugin developed by Angelo Zerr.
3.  [TypeScript Plug-in for Eclipse](https://github.com/palantir/eclipse-typescript): an Eclipse plugin developed by Palantir.
4.  WebStorm includes TypeScript support out of the box.

Visit [TypeScript Github Repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/TypeScript-Editor-Support) for the full list of IDEs that support TypeScript development.

## TypeScript Playground

TypeScript provides an online playground [https://www.typescriptlang.org/play](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play) to write and test your code on the fly without the need to download or install anything.

This is a great place for beginners to learn TypeScript and try different TypeScript features. You also have the option to share your code via a shareable link provided by the playground.
