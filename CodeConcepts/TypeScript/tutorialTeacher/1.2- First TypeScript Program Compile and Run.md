Here, you will learn to write a simple program in TypeScript, compile it and use it in the web page.

Create a new file in your code editor and name it `add.ts` and write the following code in it.

    function addNumbers(a: number, b: number) { 
        return a + b; 
    } 
    
    var sum: number = addNumbers(10, 15) 
    
    console.log('Sum of the two numbers is: ' +sum); 
    

The above TypeScript code defines the `addNumbers()` function, call it, and log the result in the browser's console.

Now, open the command prompt on Windows (or a terminal on your platform), navigate to the path where you saved `add.ts`, and compile the program using the following command:

tsc add.ts

The above command will compile the TypeScript file `add.ts` and create the Javascript file named `add.js` at the same location. The `add.js` file contains the following code.

    function addNumbers(a, b) {
        return a + b;
    }
    
    var sum = addNumbers(10, 15);
    
    console.log('Sum of the two numbers is: ' + sum);
    

As you can see, the TypeScript compiler compiled `add.ts` TypeScript file to Javascript file `ad.js`. You can now include the `add.js` file in a web page using a [script](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/javascript/script-tag "Include JavaScript File using script tag") tag and see the result in the browser's developer console.

Now, let's see how TypeScript compiles the program if we pass a string parameter to the `addNumbers()` function instead of a number.

Replace `var sum:number = addNumbers(10, 15)` in add.ts with `var sum:number = addNumbers(10,'abc')` and recompile the add.ts file in the terminal. You will get the following compilation error!

C:\\> tsc add.ts  
add2.ts(5,32): error TS2345: Argument of type 'abc' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.

So, TypeScript does not compile the code if you pass a string to a function that is expecting a number! Most IDE will display TypeScript errors instantly without compiling the code.

Thus, [static type-checking with type annotations](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/typescript/type-annotation) and several other TypeScript features like [interface](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/typescript/typescript-interface), [class](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/typescript/typescript-class), and [module](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/typescript/typescript-module) help programmers write cleaner and more scalable code that can be shared across teams.
