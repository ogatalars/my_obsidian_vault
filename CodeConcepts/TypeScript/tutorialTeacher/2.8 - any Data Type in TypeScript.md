TypeScript has type-checking and compile-time checks. However, we do not always have prior knowledge about the type of some variables, especially when there are user-entered values from third party libraries. In such cases, we need a provision that can deal with dynamic content. The Any type comes in handy here.

    let something: any = "Hello World!"; 
    something = 23;
    something = true;
    

The above code will compile into the following JavaScript.

    var something = "Hello World!";
    something = 23;
    something = true;
    

Similarly, you can create an array of type any\[\] if you are not sure about the types of values that can contain this array.

    let arr: any[] = ["John", 212, true]; 
    arr.push("Smith"); 
    console.log(arr); //Output: [ 'John', 212, true, 'Smith' ] 
    

The above example will generate the following JavaScript code:

    var arr = ["John", 212, true];
    arr.push("Smith");
    console.log(arr);
