## TypeScript Data Type - Enum

Enums or enumerations are a new data type supported in TypeScript. Most object-oriented languages like Java and C# use enums. This is now available in TypeScript too.

In simple words, enums allow us to declare a set of named constants i.e. a collection of related values that can be numeric or string values.

There are three types of enums:

1.  Numeric enum
2.  String enum
3.  Heterogeneous enum

## Numeric Enum

Numeric enums are number-based enums i.e. they store string values as numbers.

Enums can be defined using the keyword enum. Let's say we want to store a set of print media types. The corresponding enum in TypeScript would be:

    enum PrintMedia {
      Newspaper,
      Newsletter,
      Magazine,
      Book
    }
    

In the above example, we have an enum named PrintMedia. The enum has four values: Newspaper, Newsletter, Magazine, and Book. Here, enum values start from zero and increment by 1 for each member. It would be represented as:

    Newspaper = 0
    Newsletter = 1
    Magazine = 2
    Book = 3
    

Enums are always assigned numeric values when they are stored. The first value always takes the numeric value of 0, while the other values in the enum are incremented by 1.

We also have the option to initialize the first numeric value ourselves. For example, we can write the same enum as:

    enum PrintMedia {
      Newspaper = 1,
      Newsletter,
      Magazine,
      Book
    }
    

The first member, Newspaper, is initialized with the numeric value 1. The remaining members will be incremented by 1 from the numeric value of the first value. Thus, in the above example, Newsletter would be 2, Magazine would be 3 and Book would be 4.

It is not necessary to assign sequential values to Enum members. They can have any values.

    enum PrintMedia {
        Newspaper = 1,
        Newsletter = 5,
        Magazine = 5,
        Book = 10
    }
    

The enum can be used as a function parameter or return type, as shown below:

    enum PrintMedia {
        Newspaper = 1,
        Newsletter,
        Magazine,
        Book
    }
    
    function getMedia(mediaName: string): PrintMedia {
        if (  mediaName === 'Forbes' || mediaName === 'Outlook') {
            return PrintMedia.Magazine;
        }
     }
    
    let mediaType: PrintMedia = getMedia('Forbes'); // returns Magazine
    

In the above example, we declared an enum `PrintMedia`. Next, we declare a function `getMedia()` that takes in an input parameter `mediaName` of the type string. This function returns an enum `PrintMedia`. In the function, we check for the type of media. If the media name matches 'Forbes' or 'Outlook', we return enum member `PrintMedia.Magazine`.

### Computed Enums:

Numeric enums can include members with computed numeric value. The value of an enum member can be either a constant or computed. The following enum includes members with computed values.

    enum PrintMedia {
        Newspaper = 1,
        Newsletter = getPrintMediaCode('newsletter'),
        Magazine = Newsletter * 3,
        Book = 10
    }
    
    function getPrintMediaCode(mediaName: string): number {
        if (mediaName === 'newsletter') {
            return 5;
        }
    }
    
    PrintMedia.Newsetter; // returns 5
    PrintMedia.Magazine; // returns 15
    

When the enum includes computed and constant members, then uninitiated enum members either must come first or must come after other initialized members with numeric constants. The following will give an error.

    enum PrintMedia {
        Newsletter = getPrintMediaCode('newsletter'),
        Newspaper, // Error: Enum member must have initializer
        Book,
        Magazine = Newsletter * 3,
    }
    

The above enum can be declared as below.

    enum PrintMedia {
        Newspaper,
        Book,
        Newsletter = getPrintMediaCode('newsletter'),
        Magazine = Newsletter * 3
    }
    // or
    enum PrintMedia {
        Newsletter = getPrintMediaCode('newsletter'),
        Magazine = Newsletter * 3,
        Newspaper = 0,
        Book,
    }
    

## String Enum

String enums are similar to numeric enums, except that the enum values are initialized with string values rather than numeric values.

The benefits of using string enums is that string enums offer better readability. If we were to debug a program, it is easier to read string values rather than numeric values.

Consider the same example of a numeric enum, but represented as a string enum:

    enum PrintMedia {
        Newspaper = "NEWSPAPER",
        Newsletter = "NEWSLETTER",
        Magazine = "MAGAZINE",
        Book = "BOOK"
    }
    // Access String Enum 
    PrintMedia.Newspaper; //returns NEWSPAPER
    PrintMedia['Magazine'];//returns MAGAZINE
    

In the above example, we have defined a string enum, PrintMedia, with the same values as the numeric enum above, with the difference that these enum values are initialized with string literals. The difference between numeric and string enums is that numeric enum values are auto-incremented, while string enum values need to be individually initialized.

## Heterogeneous Enum

Heterogeneous enums are enums that contain both string and numeric values.

    enum Status { 
        Active = 'ACTIVE', 
        Deactivate = 1, 
        Pending
    }
    

## Reverse Mapping

Enum in TypeScript supports reverse mapping. It means we can access the value of a member and also a member name from its value. Consider the following example.

    enum PrintMedia {
      Newspaper = 1,
      Newsletter,
      Magazine,
      Book
    }
    
    PrintMedia.Magazine;   // returns  3
    PrintMedia["Magazine"];// returns  3
    PrintMedia[3];         // returns  Magazine
    

As you can see in the above example, `PrintMedia[3]` returns its member name "Magazine". This is because of reverse mapping. Let's see how TypeScript implements reverse mapping using the following example.

    enum PrintMedia {
      Newspaper = 1,
      Newsletter,
      Magazine,
      Book
    }
    console.log(PrintMedia)
    

The above example gives the following output in the browser console.

```
{
  '1': 'Newspaper',
  '2': 'Newsletter',
  '3': 'Magazine',
  '4': 'Book',
  Newspaper: 1,
  Newsletter: 2,
  Magazine: 3,
  Book: 4 
}

```

You will see that each value of the enum appears twice in the internally stored enum object. We know that num values can be retrieved using the corresponding enum member value. But it is also true that enum members can be retrieved using their values. This is called reverse mapping.

TypeScript can compile the above enum into the following JavaScript function.

    var PrintMedia;
    (function (PrintMedia) {
        PrintMedia[PrintMedia["Newspaper"] = 1] = "Newspaper";
        PrintMedia[PrintMedia["Newsletter"] = 2] = "Newsletter";
        PrintMedia[PrintMedia["Magazine"] = 3] = "Magazine";
        PrintMedia[PrintMedia["Book"] = 4] = "Book";
    })(PrintMedia || (PrintMedia = {}));
    

`PrintMedia` is an object in JavaScript which includes both value and name as properties and that's why enum in TypeScript supports reverse mapping.

So, both the following mappings are true to enums: name -> value, and value -> name.

Reverse mapping is not supported for string enum members. For the heterogeneous enum, reverse mapping is only supported for numeric type members but not for string type members.
