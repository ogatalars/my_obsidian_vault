Boolean values are supported by both JavaScript and TypeScript and stored as true/false values.

TypeScript Boolean:

`let isPresent:boolean = true;`

Note that, the boolean `Boolean` is different from the lower case `boolean` type. The upper case `Boolean` is an object type whereas lower case `boolean` is a primitive type. It is recommended to use the primitive type `boolean` in your code, because, while JavaScript coerces an object to its primitive type, the TypeScript type system does not. TypeScript treats it like an object type.

So, instead of using upper case `function checkExistence(b: Boolean)`, use the lower case `function checkExistence(b: boolean)` boolean type.
