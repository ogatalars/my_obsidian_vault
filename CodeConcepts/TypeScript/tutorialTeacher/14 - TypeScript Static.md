ES6 includes static members and so does TypeScript. The static members of a class are accessed using the class name and dot notation, without creating an object e.g. <ClassName>.<StaticMember>.

The static members can be defined by using the keyword _static_. Consider the following example of a class with static property.

    class Circle {
        static pi: number = 3.14;
    }
    

The above `Circle` class includes a static property `pi`. This can be accessed using `Circle.pi`. TypeScript will generate the following JavaScript code for the above `Circle` class.

    var Circle = /** @class */ (function () {
        function Circle() {
        }
        Circle.pi = 3.14;
        return Circle;
    }());
    

The following example defines a class with static property and method and how to access it.

    class Circle {
        static pi: number = 3.14;
        
        static calculateArea(radius:number) {
            return this.pi * radius * radius;
        }
    }
    Circle.pi; // returns 3.14
    Circle.calculateArea(5); // returns 78.5
    

The above `Circle` class includes a static property and a static method. Inside the static method `calculateArea`, the static property can be accessed using this keyword or using the class name `Circle.pi`.

Now, consider the following example with static and non-static members.

    class Circle {
        static pi = 3.14;
        pi = 3;
    }
    
    Circle.pi; // returns 3.14
    
    let circleObj = new Circle();
    circleObj.pi; // returns 3
    

As you can see, static and non-static fields with the same name can exists without any error. The static field will be accessed using dot notation and the non-static field can be accessed using an object.

Let's see another example.

    class Circle {
        static pi = 3.14;
    
        static calculateArea(radius:number) {
            return this.pi * radius * radius;
        }
    
        calculateCircumference(radius:number):number { 
            return 2 * Circle.pi * radius;
        }
    }
    
    Circle.calculateArea(5); // returns 78.5
    
    let circleObj = new Circle();
    circleObj.calculateCircumference(5) // returns 31.4000000
    //circleObj.calculateArea(); <-- cannot call this
    

In the above example, the `Circle` class includes static method `calculateArea` and non-static method `calculateCircumference`. As you can see, the static field `pi` can be accessed in the static method using `this.pi` and in the non-static (instance) method using `Circle.pi`.

The class or constructor cannot be static in TypeScript.
