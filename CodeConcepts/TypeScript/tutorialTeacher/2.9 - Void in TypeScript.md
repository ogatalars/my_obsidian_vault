## TypeScript Data Type - Void

Similar to languages like Java, void is used where there is no data. For example, if a function does not return any value then you can specify void as return type.

    function sayHi(): void { 
        console.log('Hi!')
    } 
    
    let speech: void = sayHi(); 
    console.log(speech); //Output: undefined
    

There is no meaning to assign void to a variable, as only null or undefined is assignable to void.

    let nothing: void = undefined;
    let num: void = 1; // Error
