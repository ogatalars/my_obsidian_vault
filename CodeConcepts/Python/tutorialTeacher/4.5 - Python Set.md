A set is a mutable collection of distinct hashable objects, same as the [list](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/python-list) and [tuple](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/python-tuple). It is an unordered collection of objects, meaning it does not record element position or order of insertion and so cannot access elements using indexes.

The set is a Python implementation of the set in Mathematics. A set object has suitable methods to perform mathematical set operations like union, intersection, difference, etc.

A set object contains one or more items, not necessarily of the same type, which are separated by a comma and enclosed in curly brackets {}. The following defines a set object with even numbers.

    even_nums = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10} # set of even numbers
    emp = {1, 'Steve', 10.5, True} # set of different objects
    

A set doesn't store duplicate objects. Even if an object is added more than once inside the curly brackets, only one copy is held in the set object. Hence, indexing and slicing operations cannot be done on a set object.

    >>> nums = {1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5}
    >>> nums
    {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    

The order of elements in the set is not necessarily the same as the order given at the time of assignment. Python optimizes the structure of a set for performing operations over it, as defined in mathematics.

Only immutable (and hashable) objects can be a part of a set object. Numbers (integer, float, as well as complex), strings, and tuple objects are accepted, but set, list, and dictionary objects are not.

    >>> myset = {(10,10), 10, 20} # valid
    >>> myset
    {10, 20, (10, 10)}
    >>> myset = {[10, 10], 10, 20}  # can't add a list
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<pyshell#9>", line 1, in <module>
        myset = {[10, 10], 10, 20}
    TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
    >>> myset = { {10, 10}, 10, 20} # can't add a set
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<pyshell#9>", line 1, in <module>
        myset = { {10, 10}, 10, 20}
    TypeError: unhashable type: 'set'
    

In the above example, `(10,10)` is a tuple, hence it becomes part of the set. However, `[10,10]` is a list, hence an error message is displayed saying that the list is unhashable. ([Hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) is a mechanism in computer science which enables quicker search of objects in the computer's memory.)

Even though mutable objects are not stored in a set, the set itself is a mutable object.

Use the [set() function](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/set-method) to create an empty set. Empty curly braces will create an empty [dictionary](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/python-dictionary) instead of an empty set.

    >>> emp = {} # creates an empty dictionary
    >>> type(emp)
    <class 'dict'>
    >>> s = set() # creates an empty set
    >>> type(s)
    <class 'set'>
    

The [set() function](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/set-method) also use to convert string, tuple, or dictionary object to a set object, as shown below.

    >>> s = set('Hello') # converts string to set
    >>> s
    {'l', 'H', 'o', 'e'}
    >>> s = set((1,2,3,4,5)) # converts tuple to set
    >>> s
    {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    >>> d = {1:'One', 2: 'Two'} 
    >>> s = set(d) # converts dict to set
    >>> s
    {1, 2}

## Modify Set Elements

Use built-in set functions [add()](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/set-add), [remove()](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/set-remove) or [update()](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/set-update) methods to modify set collection.

    >>> s = set() # creates an empty set
    >>> s.add(10) # add an element
    >>> s.add(20)
    >>> s.add(30)
    >>> s
    {10, 20, 30}
    >>> primeNums = {2, 3, 5, 7}
    >>> s.update(primeNums) # update set with another set
    >>> s
    {2, 3, 20, 5, 7, 10, 30}
    >>> s.remove(2) # remove an element
    >>> s
    {3, 20, 5, 7, 10, 30}
    

## Set Operations

As mentioned earlier, the set data type in Python implements as the set defined in mathematics. Various set operations can be performed. Operators |, &, - and ^ perform union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference operations, respectively. Each of these operators has a corresponding method associated with the built-in set class.

| Operation | Example |
| --- | --- |
| **Union:** Returns a new set with elements from both the sets.
**Operator:** |  
**Method:** [set.union()](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/set-union)

 | 

    >>> s1={1,2,3,4,5}
    >>> s2={4,5,6,7,8}
    >>> s1|s2         
    {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

 |
| 

    >>> s1={1,2,3,4,5}
    >>> s2={4,5,6,7,8}
    >>> s1.union(s2)  
    {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}   
    >>> s2.union(s1)  
    {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

    >>> s1&s2         
    {4, 5}                     
    >>> s2&s1

    >>> s1.intersection(s2)    
    {4, 5}                              
    >>> s2.intersection(s1)    
    {4, 5}

 |
| **Difference:** Returns a set containing elements only in the first set, but not in the second set.

    >>> s2={4,5,6,7,8}
    >>> s1-s2         
    {1, 2, 3}                  
    >>> s2-s1         
    {8, 6, 7}

    >>> s2={4,5,6,7,8}    
    >>> s1.difference(s2) 
    {1, 2, 3}                      
    >>> s2.difference(s1) 
    {8, 6, 7}

 |
| **Symmetric Difference:** Returns a set consisting of elements in both sets, excluding the common elements.

**Operator:** ^  
**Method:** [set.symmetric\_difference()](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/set-symmetric-difference)

    >>> s2={4,5,6,7,8}
    >>> s1^s2         
    {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}         
    >>> s2^s1         
    {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}

 |
| 

    >>> s1={1,2,3,4,5}             
    >>> s2={4,5,6,7,8}             
    >>> s1.symmetric_difference(s2)
    {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}                      
    >>> s2.symmetric_difference(s1)
    {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
