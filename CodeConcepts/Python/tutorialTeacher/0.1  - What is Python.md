Python is a high-level, cross-platform, and open-sourced programming language released under a GPL-compatible license. [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf-landing/) (PSF), a non-profit organization, holds the copyright of Python.

Guido Van Rossum conceived Python in the late 1980s. It was released in 1991 at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language. He named this language after a popular comedy show called 'Monty Python's Flying Circus' (and not after Python-the snake).

In the last few years, its popularity has increased immensely. According to stackoverflow.com's recent survey, Python is in the top three [Most Loved Programming Language in 2020](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages-loved).

## Python Features:

-   Python is an interpreter-based language, which allows the execution of one instruction at a time.
-   Extensive basic data types are supported e.g., numbers (floating point, complex, and unlimited-length long integers), strings (both ASCII and Unicode), lists, and dictionaries.
-   Variables can be strongly typed as well as dynamic typed.
-   Supports object-oriented programming concepts such as class, inheritance, objects, module, namespace etc.
-   Cleaner exception handling support.
-   Supports automatic memory management.
-   Various built-in and third-party modules, which can be imported and used independently in the Python application.

## Python Advantages

-   Python provides enhanced readability. For that purpose, uniform indents are used to delimit blocks of statements instead of curly brackets, like in many languages such as C, C++, and Java.
-   Python is free and distributed as open-source software. A large programming community is actively involved in the development and support of Python libraries for various applications such as web frameworks, mathematical computing, and data science.
-   Python is a cross-platform language. It works equally on different OS platforms like Windows, Linux, Mac OSX, etc. Hence Python applications can be easily ported across OS platforms.
-   Python supports multiple programming paradigms including imperative, procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming styles.
-   Python is an extensible language. Additional functionality (other than what is provided in the core language) can be made available through modules and packages written in other languages (C, C++, Java, etc.)
-   A standard DB-API for database connectivity has been defined in Python. It can be enabled using any data source (Oracle, MySQL, SQLite etc.) as a backend to the Python program for storage, retrieval, and processing of data.
-   The standard distribution of Python contains the Tkinter GUI toolkit, which is the implementation of a popular GUI library called Tcl/Tk. An attractive GUI can be constructed using Tkinter. Many other GUI libraries like Qt, GTK, WxWidgets, etc. are also ported to Python.
-   Python can be integrated with other popular programming technologies like C, C++, Java, ActiveX, and CORBA.
