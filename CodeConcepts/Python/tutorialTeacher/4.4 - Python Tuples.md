Tuple is an immutable (unchangeable) collection of elements of different data types. It is an ordered collection, so it preserves the order of elements in which they were defined.

Tuples are defined by enclosing elements in parentheses `()`, separated by a comma. The following declares a tuple type variable.

    tpl=() # empty tuple
    print(tpl)
    
    names = ('Jeff', 'Bill', 'Steve', 'Yash') # string tuple
    print(names)
    
    nums = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) # int tuple
    print(nums)
    
    employee=(1, 'Steve', True, 25, 12000)  # heterogeneous data tuple
    print(employee)
    

    ()
    ('Jeff', 'Bill', 'Steve', 'Yash')
    (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    (1, 'Steve', True, 25, 12000)
    

However, it is not necessary to enclose the tuple elements in parentheses. The tuple object can include elements separated by a comma without parentheses.

    names = 'Jeff', 'Bill', 'Steve', 'Yash' # string tuple
    print(names)
    
    nums = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 # int tuple
    print(nums)
    
    employee=1, 'Steve', True, 25, 12000  # heterogeneous data tuple
    print(employee)
    

    ('Jeff', 'Bill', 'Steve', 'Yash')
    (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    (1, 'Steve', True, 25, 12000)
    

Tuples cannot be declared with a single element unless followed by a comma.

    names = ('Jeff') # considered as string type
    print(names)
    print(type(names))
    
    names = ('Jeff',) # tuple with single element
    print(names)
    print(type(names))
    

    'Jeff'
    <class 'string'>
    (Jeff)
    <class 'tuple'>
    

## Access Tuple Elements

Each element in the tuple is accessed by the index in the square brackets \[\]. An index starts with zero and ends with (number of elements - 1), as shown below.

    names = ('Jeff', 'Bill', 'Steve', 'Yash') 
    print(names[0]) # prints 'Jeff'
    print(names[1]) # prints 'Bill'
    print(names[2]) # prints 'Steve'
    print(names[3]) # prints 'Yash'
    
    nums = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) 
    print(nums[0]) # prints 1
    print(nums[1]) # prints 2
    print(nums[4]) # prints 5
    

    Jeff
    Bill
    Steve
    Yash
    1
    2
    5
    

The tuple supports negative indexing also, the same as list type. The negative index for the first element starts from `-number of elements` and ends with -1 for the last element.

    names = ('Jeff', 'Bill', 'Steve', 'Yash') 
    print(names[-4]) # prints 'Jeff'
    print(names[-3]) # prints 'Bill'
    print(names[-2]) # prints 'Steve'
    print(names[-1]) # prints 'Yash'
    

If the element at the specified index does not exist, then the error "index out of range" will be thrown.

    >>> names[5]
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    IndexError: tuple index out of range
    

Tuple elements can be unpacked and assigned to variables, as shown below. However, the number of variables must match with the number of elements in a tuple; otherwise, an error will be thrown.

    names = ('Jeff', 'Bill', 'Steve', 'Yash') 
    a, b, c, d = names # unpack tuple
    print(a, b, c, d)
    

## Update or Delete Tuple Elements

Tuple is unchangeable. So, once a tuple is created, any operation that seeks to change its contents is not allowed. For instance, trying to modify or delete an element of `names` tuple will result in an error.

    >>> names = ('Jeff', 'Bill', 'Steve', 'Yash') 
    >>> names[0] = 'Swati'
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
    
    >>> del names[0]
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    TypeError: 'tuple' object doesn't support item deletion
    

However, you can delete an entire tuple using the `del` keyword.

## Tuple Class

The underlying type of a tuple is the tuple class. Check the type of a variable using the `type()` function.

    names = ('Jeff', 'Bill', 'Steve', 'Yash') 
    print('names type: ', type(names))
    
    nums = (1,2,3,4,5) 
    print('nums type: ', type(nums))
    

    names type: <class 'tuple'>
    nums type: <class 'tuple'>
    

The `tuple()` constructor is used to convert any iterable to tuple type.

    tpl = tuple('Hello') # converts string to tuple
    print(tpl)
    tpl = tuple([1,2,3,4,5]) # converts list to tuple
    print(tpl)
    tpl = tuple({1,2,3,4,5}) # converts set to tuple
    print(tpl)
    tpl = tuple({1:"One",2:"Two"}) # converts dictionary to tuple
    print(tpl)
    

    ('H','e','l','l','o')
    (1,2,3,4,5)
    (1,2,3,4,5)
    (1,2)
    

## Tuple Operations

Like string, tuple objects are also a sequence. Hence, the operators used with strings are also available for the tuple.

| Operator | Example |
| --- | --- |
| The **+** operator returns a tuple containing all the elements of the first and the second tuple object. | 
    >>> t1=(1,2,3)
    >>> t2=(4,5,6)         
    >>> t1+t2              
    (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) 
    >>> t2+(7,)            
    (4, 5, 6, 7)

 |
| The **\*** operator Concatenates multiple copies of the same tuple. | 

    >>> t1=(1,2,3)
    >>> t1*4                             
    (1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3)

 |
| The **\[\]** operator Returns the item at the given index. A negative index counts the position from the right side. | 

    >>> t1=(1,2,3,4,5,6)     
    >>> t1[3]                
    4                        
    >>> t1[-2]               
    5

 |
| The **\[:\]** operator returns the items in the range specified by two index operands separated by the `:` symbol.  
If the first operand is omitted, the range starts from zero. If the second operand is omitted, the range goes up to the end of the tuple. | 

    >>> t1=(1,2,3,4,5,6) 
    >>> t1[1:3]              
    (2, 3)                   
    >>> t1[3:]               
    (4, 5, 6)                
    >>> t1[:3]               
    (1, 2, 3)

 |
| The **in** operator returns true if an item exists in the given tuple. | 

    >>> t1=(1,2,3,4,5,6) 
    >>> 5 in t1
    True                
    >>> 10 in t1 
    False

 |
| The **not in** operator returns true if an item does not exist in the given tuple. | 

    >>> t1=(1,2,3,4,5,6) 
    >>> 4 not in t1 
    False                    
    >>> 10 not in t1
    True
