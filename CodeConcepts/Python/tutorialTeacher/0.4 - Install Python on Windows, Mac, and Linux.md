Python can be installed on Windows, Linux, Mac OS as well as certain other platforms such as IBM AS/400, iOS, Solaris, etc.

To install Python on your local machine, get a copy of the standard distribution of Python software from [https://www.python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) based on your operating system, hardware architecture and version of your local machine.

## Install Python on Windows

To install Python on a Windows platform, you need to download the installer. A web-based installer, executable installer and embeddable zip files are available to install Python on Windows. Visit [https://www.python.org/downloads/windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows) and download the installer based on your local machine's hardware architecture.

The web-based installer needs an active internet connection. So, you can also download the standalone executable installer. Visit [https://www.python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads) and click on the **Download Python 3.7.0** button as shown below. (3.7.0 is the latest version as of this writing.)

Python 3.7.0

## Install Python on Mac OS X

You can install Python by downloading official installer from [https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/) page. Download the latest version of Python under the heading Python Releases for Mac OS X. Double click on the installer file to start the installation wizard.

On the installation wizard, click on `Continue` a few times until you're asked to agree to the software license agreement, click on `Agree` and finish the installation.

## Install Python on Linux

Most of Linux distributions come with Python already installed. However, the Python 2.x version is incorporated in many of them. To check if Python 3.x is available, run the following command in the Linux terminal:

$ which python3

If available, it will return the path to the Python3 executable as `/usr/local/bin/python3`.

To install Python on Ubuntu 18.04, Ubuntu 20.04 and above, execute the following commands:

$ sudo apt-get update  
$ sudo apt-get install python3.7 python3-pip

After the installation, you can run Python 3.8 and pip3 commands.

For other Linux distributions use the corresponding package managers, such as YUM for Red Hat, aptitude for debian, DNF for Fedora, etc.

For installation on other platforms as well as installation from the source code, please refer to the official documentation on [Python Source Releases](https://www.python.org/downloads/source/) page.
