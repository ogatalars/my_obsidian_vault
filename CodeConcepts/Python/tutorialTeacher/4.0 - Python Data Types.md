Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. Python supports the following built-in data types.

## Scalar Types

-   [int](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/python-number-type#int): Positive or negative whole numbers (without a fractional part) e.g. -10, 10, 456, 4654654.
-   [float](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/python-number-type#float): Any real number with a floating-point representation in which a fractional component is denoted by a decimal symbol or scientific notation e.g. 1.23, 3.4556789e2.
-   [complex](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/python-number-type#complex): A number with a real and imaginary component represented as `x + 2y`.
-   **bool**: Data with one of two built-in values `True` or `False`. Notice that 'T' and 'F' are capital. `true` and `false` are not valid booleans and Python will throw an error for them.
-   **None**: The `None` represents the null object in Python. A `None` is returned by functions that don't explicitly return a value.

## Sequence Type

A sequence is an ordered collection of similar or different data types. Python has the following built-in sequence data types:

-   [String](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/python-string): A string value is a collection of one or more characters put in single, double or triple quotes.
-   [List](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/python-list): A list object is an ordered collection of one or more data items, not necessarily of the same type, put in square brackets.
-   [Tuple](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/python-tuple): A Tuple object is an ordered collection of one or more data items, not necessarily of the same type, put in parentheses.

## Mapping Type

[Dictionary](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/python-dictionary): A dictionary `Dict()` object is an unordered collection of data in a key:value pair form. A collection of such pairs is enclosed in curly brackets. For example: `{1:"Steve", 2:"Bill", 3:"Ram", 4: "Farha"}`

## Set Types

-   [set](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/python-set): Set is mutable, unordered collection of distinct hashable objects. The set is a Python implementation of the set in Mathematics. A set object has suitable methods to perform mathematical set operations like union, intersection, difference, etc.
-   **frozenset**: Frozenset is immutable version of set whose elements are added from other iterables.

### Mutable and Immutable Types

Data objects of the above types are stored in a computer's memory for processing. Some of these values can be modified during processing, but contents of others can't be altered once they are created in the memory.

[Numbers](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/python-number-type), [strings](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/python-string), and [Tuples](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/python-tuple) are immutable, which means their contents can't be altered after creation.

On the other hand, items in a [List](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/python-list) or [Dictionary](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/python-dictionary) object can be modified. It is possible to add, delete, insert, and rearrange items in a list or dictionary. Hence, they are mutable objects.
