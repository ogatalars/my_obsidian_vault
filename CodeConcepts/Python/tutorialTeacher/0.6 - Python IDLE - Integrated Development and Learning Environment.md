IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment) is an integrated development environment (IDE) for Python. The Python installer for Windows contains the IDLE module by default.

IDLE is not available by default in Python distributions for Linux. It needs to be installed using the respective package managers. Execute the following command to install IDLE on Ubuntu:

$ sudo apt-get install idle

IDLE can be used to execute a single statement just like Python Shell and also to create, modify, and execute Python scripts. IDLE provides a fully-featured text editor to create Python script that includes features like syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and smart indent. It also has a debugger with stepping and breakpoints features.

To start an IDLE interactive shell, search for the IDLE icon in the start menu and double click on it.
