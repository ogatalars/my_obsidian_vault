## [Binary](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/notes/1/#binary)

-   We use computers everyday
-   Inside a computer are ‚Äú0s and 1s‚Äù
    -   Computers use the binary number system to represent info
        -   How do computers represent info with just binary?
-   Consider the decimal number (what we human typically use) 123
    -   The rightmost column is the 1s column
    -   The middle, the 10s
    -   The leftmost, the 100s

        100
        
        
        
         | 
        
        10

         |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        | 1 | 2 | 3 |
        
    -   Thus we have 100 x 1 + 10 x 2 + 1 x 3 = 100 + 20 + 3 = 123
-   Inside a computer, the binary 000 would represent 0, just like in our human world!
    -   However, in this case we are dealing with binary so:
        
        -   The right most column is the 1s place
        -   The middle, the 2s
        -   The leftmost, the 4s

        | --- | --- | --- |
        | 0 | 0 | 0 |
        
    -   In the human world (decimal) we use powers of 10 for place values
        -   10<sup>0</sup> = 1, 10<sup>1</sup> = 10, 10<sup>2</sup> = 100, 10<sup>3</sup> = 1000, etc.
    -   In the computer world (binary) we use powers of 2 for place values
        -   2<sup>0</sup> = 1, 2<sup>1</sup> = 2, 2<sup>2</sup> = 4, 2<sup>3</sup> = 8, etc.
    -   The difference between decimal numbers and binary numbers is changing the base
    -   For the binary number 000, we have 4 x 0 + 2 x 0 + 1 x 0 = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0!
-   Consider the binary number 001:

     |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | 0 | 0 | 1 |
    
    -   We have 4 x 0 + 2 x 0 + 1 x 1 = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
-   How do we represent the decimal number 2 in binary?
    
    -   We don‚Äôt need a 4, be we need a 2, and also no 1

    | 0 | 1 | 0 |
    
    -   This gives us 4 x 0 + 2 x 1 + 1 x 0 = 0 + 2 + 0 = 2
-   Likewise, the number 3 would be:

    | 0 | 1 | 1 |
    
    -   As we need a 2 and a 1
    -   Thus, 4 x 0 + 2 x 1 + 1 x 1 = 0 + 2 + 1 = 3
-   Similarly, 4 would be:

    -   Which yields 4 x 1 + 2 x 1 + 1 x 1 = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7
-   What about 8?
    -   We can‚Äôt count to 8 without another bit (binary digit)
        
        -   We run into this in the real world too if we need a four-digit number vs a 3-digit number
            -   Start with the 1s, 10s, 100s place and add the 1000s
        -   Here we‚Äôll add the next power of 2, 8

        | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
        
        -   8 x 1 + 4 x 0 + 2 x 0 + 1 x 0 = 8
-   Even though computers only use binary, they can count as high as humans can!
    -   They do it with a smaller vocabulary, just 1 and 0.
        -   This is because it‚Äôs easier to represent two states in the physical world
            -   If you think of one of these bits as being a light bulb:
                -   0 is off
                -   1 is on
            -   Light bulbs just need electricity to turn on or off
            -   Electricity is sufficient to turn a switch on or off
                -   Inside a computer exists these switches called transistors
                    -   Modern computers have billions!
                    -   Turned off represents 0
                    -   Turned on represents 1
-   Using these transistors we can store values, store data, compute, and do everything we can with computers
-   David demonstrates how transistors work using light bulbs
-   So far all that we can represent is numbers
    -   A decision needs to be made on what pattern of 1s and 0s to represent letters, words, and paragraphs
    -   All computers can store is 0s and 1s
    -   To represent letters, we need a mapping of 0s and 1s to characters
        
        -   ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) does this
        
        ![](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/notes/1/ascii.png)
        
        -   65 -> A, 66 -> B, 67 -> C, etc.
        -   97 -> a, 98 -> b, 99 -> c, etc.
        -   ASCII also has mapping for punctuation symbols
    -   Programs like notepad, textedit, and MicroSoft Word decide weather to display patterns of bits as letters or words
        -   Computers only store 0s and 1s, but the programs interpret those bits in a certain way
            -   For example, if MicroSoft word sees a pattern of buts representing the number 65, it will interpret that as ‚ÄúA‚Äù
    -   ASCII is limited
        -   Original ASCII is 7 bits, thus giving 128 characters
            -   Extended ASCII is 8 bits, yielding 256 characters
        -   Many symbols are not represented
    -   UNICODE is a bigger set of characters that includes written languages other than English and even emoji! ![üò≤](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/14.0.2/72x72/1f632.png)
        -   All are still represented by a pattern of bits
-   Consider this pattern of bits: 01001000 01001001
    
    -   16 bits or 2 bytes (1 byte = 8 bits)

## [CPU](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/notes/1/#cpu)

-   If you have heard that your computer has ‚ÄúIntel Inside,‚Äù it has an Intel processor in it
    
    ![](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/notes/1/intel.png)
    
    -   The backside of the processor has pins that connect into the motherboard
        -   The motherboard is a circuit board made of silicon
-   The CPU is the brain of the computer
    -   Does all the thinking
    -   Performs math in numbers fed to it
    -   Helps display numbers on a screen
    -   Adds or deletes numbers
-   CPUs now can have multiple cores
    -   Cores are the devices inside the CPU that can preform mathematical operations, load info from memory, save info to memory, etc.
    -   The more cores, the more tasks a CPU can do at once
-   CPUs now also support hyper-threading
    -   Where a single core will present itself as multiple cores to a computer‚Äôs operating system
-   Systems on a Chip (SoaC) are when a CPU and more are all interconnected at once rather than attached to a motherboard
    -   Popular in phones, tables, and game consoles
    -   Raspberry Pi
        
        ![](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/notes/1/pi.png)
        

## [RAM (Random Access Memory)](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/notes/1/#ram-random-access-memory)

-   Circuit board with chips that slides into a slot on the motherboard
    
    ![](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/notes/1/ram.png)
    
    -   The chips store data
        -   Only stores data when the power is on
    -   Files and programs are loaded onto these chips when ran
    -   Fast memory
-   You can check your RAM and other specs:
    
    -   Windows Task Manager
        
        ![](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/notes/1/windows.png)
        
        -   CPU chart shows when peak usage occurs
        -   GHz is the number of operations a CPU can perform per second (in billions)
            -   1.94 GHz = 1.94 billion operations per second
        -   Logical processors in this case is 4, which means both cores support hyper-threading
            -   Each core will do two things at once as if 4 cores exist
    -   Mac System Profiler
        
        ![](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/notes/1/mac.png)
        

## [Hard Drives](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/notes/1/#hard-drives)

-   When you turn a computer off, you need a place to store data
    -   A hard disk drive (HDD) stores this information
        
        ![](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/notes/1/hddout.png)
        
    -   RAM may store 1 GB, 2 GB, 4 GB, through 16 GB or so
    -   HDD stores 256 GB, 1024 GB (AKA terabyte or TB), 2 TB
    -   Inside a HDD, metal platters physically spin around
        
        ![](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/notes/1/hddinside.png)
        
        -   Data is stored on these disks
        -   The reading heads move back and forth reading data from the device
        -   Uses tiny magnetic particles where north pole orientation represents 1 and south pole orientation represents 0
            -   Power is only needed to read or change the data
                -   Data is preserved when power is off
        -   David shows a video of a HDD running in slowmo
-   To store data in a hard drive, RAM sends data and instructions to the HDD
    -   The hard drive translates that data into voltage fluctuations
        -   Some signals spin the platters, others move the read/write heads
        -   Pulses sent to the read/write head turn on a magnet which creates a field that changes the polarity of a tiny portion of the metal platter‚Äôs surface
        -   Power is sent in different directions as to change polarity
    -   To read, the particles on the disk use their charge to move the read/write head.
    -   Pieces of a file can be spread out around the platters
        -   A special file keeps track of data‚Äôs location
    -   Anytime you have a physical device that moves over a period of time, things go wrong
        -   Dropping a HDD can corrupt files
    -   Platters spin slower than how fast electrons move

## [Flash Memory](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/notes/1/#flash-memory)

-   Solid state disk (SSD)
    
    ![](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/notes/1/ssdout.png)
    
    -   Smaller (3.5 inch width for HDD vs 2.5 inch width for SSD)
        -   Still fits where old HDDs are
    -   No moving particles
    -   Inside, it looks a lot like RAM
        
        ![](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/notes/1/ssdinside.png)
        
    -   Much faster than HDD
        -   Programs/files load and save more quickly
    -   SSD theoretically don‚Äôt last as long as HDD
        -   Finite number of writes
-   Hybrid Drives
    -   Some GB of solid state memory and more GB or TB of HDD space
    -   Stores as much of frequently-needed data on the SSD
    -   Stores less frequently-needed data on HDD
-   Flash memory also exists in the form of USB sticks
    -   Might store 1 GB, 16 GB, or more
    -   Portable
-   External SSDs exist for more storage
    -   Might store 256 GB or more
    -   Can be used to share data with others without network usage
-   Can also have external HDD

## [Types of Memory and Funneling](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/notes/1/#types-of-memory-and-funneling)

-   There is a tradeoff between space, money, and speed of data transfer
    
    ![](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/notes/1/funnel.png)
    
    -   Data is pushed ‚Äúdown the funnel‚Äù to your CPU
        -   From the hard drive, data first goes to the RAM
            
            ![](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/notes/1/tradeoff.png)
            
        -   Theoretically, the CPU never has to wait for data to crunch
        -   There is a tiny amount of memory (bytes) called registers where numbers are stored for operations.
        -   Memory at the bottom is more expensive
        -   Disk is important for the long-term storage
        -   RAM is important as it stores programs you use simultaneously
        -   L3, L2, L1 cache are on the motherboard
-   As an analogy for memory, picture a candy store
    -   A customer approaches the counter and requests candy
    -   The shop owner then leaves the counter to grab the candy before returning moments later
        -   Not super efficient to walk all the way to the store room to grab candy
            -   Better to have a cache of memory
    -   Instead, the shop owner leaves the counter to ready a cache of candy before the customers arrive
    -   When a customer comes, the candy can be distributed quickly
        -   Cache memory similarly helps the CPU in this manner
-   We can see sizes of cache looking at computer specs like before

## [Display Connectors](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/notes/1/#display-connectors)

![](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/notes/1/display.png)

-   These sockets all connect to monitors or displays
-   Mini DisplayPort are used form monitors
-   HDMI is not only on laptops and computers but also TVs
-   VGA is older, but still commonly uses on projectors

## [USB (Universal Serial Bus)](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/notes/1/#usb-universal-serial-bus)

![](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/notes/1/usb.png)

-   Can plug in a whole range of peripheral devices including printers, keyboards, mice, scanners, etc.
-   USB-A most common
-   USB-B is often used for printers and scanners
-   USB-C is newer and can be plugged in coming from different directions
-   Other variants often exist for phones
-   Older USB connections are slower when transferring data
    -   Hard drives can connect via USB
        -   Even if a hard drive is fast, if the USB is slow, the transfer of data will be slow

## [Wireless](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/notes/1/#wireless)

-   Wifi is wireless internet
-   Bluetooth allows devices such as wireless keyboards and headphones to connect to your computer
    -   Limited range
        -   This is ok as it is used for you to connect to your own device

## [Operating System (OS)](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/notes/1/#operating-system-os)

-   Software that ensures all devices work and can intercommunicate
-   MacOS and Windows are popular OS
-   Can be installed by the user, but is typically done so by a manufacturer
    -   Installed on HDD or SDD so that it exists persistently without power
-   When you hit power on your computer, the OS is loaded into RAM
-   Gives you the graphical interface that you see
-   Knows how to:
    -   Talk to your keyboard and mouse
    -   Display info on the screen
    -   Move things around in memory
-   This is all thanks to device drivers installed with the OS
    -   Special software designed to talk to certain model of printer, camera, scanner, etc.
-   When an OS doesn‚Äôt recognize a device, perhaps because it‚Äôs too new, you can download new device drives from the device manufacturer
    -   Teaches Window, MacOS, or Linux about that new hardware
    -   Future-proofing structure
-   It‚Äôs this intersection of hardware and software that makes computers powerful!

## [Looking Underneath the Hood](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/notes/1/#looking-underneath-the-hood)

-   David and Colton Ogden look at the exterior of an old ThinkPad computer, examining ports
    -   Power bricks convert power from the wall into safe amounts for the computer
-   David and Colton examine the inside of an old window desktop, highlighting the motherboard, heatsink, RAM, Hard Drive, etc.
-   David and Colton then look inside a HDD
    -   Once exposed to air and dust, it‚Äôs no longer reliable enough to use
-   David and Colton then look at a motherboard examining all the ports on it
