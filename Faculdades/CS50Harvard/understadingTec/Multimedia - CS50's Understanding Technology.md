## [Introduction](https://video.cs50.net/cscie1a/2017/fall/lectures/multimedia?t=0m10s)

-   Odds are you use it everyday, but what is it?

## [Audio](https://video.cs50.net/cscie1a/2017/fall/lectures/multimedia?t=0m17s)

-   Computers are good at recording, playing back, and generating audio
-   Uses different file formats
    -   File formats are just a way of storing 0s and 1s on disk so that certain software knows how to interpret it
-   MIDI
    -   Way of storing musical notes for certain songs
    -   Can do this for different instruments
        -   Programs can render the notes for these instruments
-   GarageBand
    
    -   Included with macOS
    
    ![GarageBand](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/notes/3/garageband.png)
    
    -   This is the Star Wars theme in MIDI
        -   Doesn’t sound quite as good as the actual version
        -   Computer synthesizes the notes
            -   Not an actual recording
            -   Computer interprets notes in the MIDI file
-   MIDI is common in the digital workspace among musicians who wish to share music with each other.
-   Humans typically like to hear music preformed and recorded by humans
    -   File formats for recorded music include:
        -   AAC
        -   MIDI
        -   MP3
        -   WAV
-   WAV is an early sound format, but still used
    -   Uncompressed data storage allowing high quality
-   MP3
    -   File format for audio that uses compression
        -   Significantly reduce how many bits are necessary to store a song
        -   Discards 0s and 1s that humans can’t necessarily hear
            -   True audiophiles may disagree
        -   Trade off between optimizing storage space and sacrificing quality
        -   This compression is said to be lossy
            -   Losing the quality in the compression process
-   AAC
    -   Similar to MP3
    -   May see when you download a song from iTunes
-   Streaming services such as Spotify don’t transfer a file to you but rather stream bits of information to you
-   How do we think about the quality of these formats?
    -   Sampling frequency
        -   Number of times per seconds we take a digital snapshot of what a person would hear
    -   Bit depth
        -   Number of bits used for these individual snapshots
    -   Sampling frequency x bit depth = number of bits necessary to store one second of music
    -   Audio file formats allow you to modify what these parameters are

## [Graphics](https://video.cs50.net/cscie1a/2017/fall/lectures/multimedia?t=5m3s)

-   A graphic, what we see with multimedia, is really just a bunch of pixels both horizontal and vertical
    -   All file formats are rectangular in nature, though transparent pixels can make images look to take on other shapes
    -   In the simplest form, each of the dots or pixels is a bunch of 0s and 1s
        
        ![smile](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/notes/3/smile.png)
        
    -   To create a file format, we just need to determine a mapping
-   This image is only black and white, so how to represent color?

## [RGB](https://video.cs50.net/cscie1a/2017/fall/lectures/multimedia?t=7m1s)

-   RGB stands for Red Green Blue
    -   With information giving an amount of red, an amount of green, and an amount of blue, you can tell a computer how to colorize pixels
    -   None of the colors yields a black pixel
    -   All of the colors yields a white pixel
    -   In between these two options is where we get all sorts of colors
-   Consider the three bytes: 11111111 00000000 00000000
    -   If we interpret these bytes to represent colors, it appears we want all of the red, none of the green, and none of the blue
    -   These 24 bits (3 bytes = 3 x 8 bits = 24 bits) represent the color we know as red!
        -   If a computer wanted to represent this color, it would store these 24 bits
-   Consider the three bytes: 00000000 11111111 00000000
    -   Green
-   Consider the three bytes: 00000000 0000000 11111111
    -   Blue
-   Consider the three bytes: 00000000 0000000 0000000
    -   Black
-   Consider the three bytes: 11111111 11111111 11111111
    -   White
-   Can get many color variations by mixing the above colors in different quantities
-   When we talk about image formats, we typically don’t talk in terms of binary but rather something called hexadecimal (base-16, contains 16 digits)
    -   0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a, b, c, d, e, f
    -   0 is the smallest number we can represent in single digit
    -   f is the largest number (value of 15) we can represent in a single digit
-   Consider the 8 bits: 1111 1111
    -   Each hexadecimal digit represents four bits
    -   One hexadecimal digit can represent the first four bits, another can represent the second four
        -   Represent something with eight symbols using only two!
    -   1111 is the decimal number 15, which is f
    -   Therefore, 1111 1111 in hexadecimal is ff
-   Red can thus be represented in hexadecimal as ff 00 00
-   Green can be represented in hexadecimal as 00 ff 00
-   Blue can be represented in hexadecimal as 00 00 ff
-   A lot of graphical editing software such as Photoshop use hexadecimal to represent colors

## [Bitmap Format](https://video.cs50.net/cscie1a/2017/fall/lectures/multimedia?t=12m45s)

![XP](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/notes/3/xp.png)

-   This background for Windows XP was a bitmap file (.bmp)
    -   A mapping or grid of bits much like the smiley face from before
-   Zooming in on this image show that it is just a grid of dots
    
    ![XP zoom](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/notes/3/xpzoom.png)
    
    -   Notice the pixelation
-   Much like with audio, so too in the world of images do you have discretion over how many bits to use
    -   How many bits to represent each pixel’s color?
    -   Resolution is another factor
        -   An image that is only 100 pixels scaled up only duplicates the existing limited information, resulting in a blotchy image
        -   Would be better to start with image that has a higher resolution (more pixels)
-   A lot of repeated colors, so it seems silly to represent each color with the same number of bits

## [Image Compression](https://video.cs50.net/cscie1a/2017/fall/lectures/multimedia?t=17m28s)

-   Graphical file formats can often be compressed
-   Can be done lossy or losslessly
    -   With audio, we threw away audio information that the human ear can’t necessarily hear
        -   This is lossy compression; throwing information away
    -   Using fewer bits to represent the same information is lossless compression
-   Lossless compression
    
    ![apples](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/notes/3/apples.png)
    
-   There is a lot of repeated blue in the first image
    -   Using the same 24 bits to represent each pixel!
-   The second image is compressed and not what a user would see
    -   The first column contains the color that the rest of the row (scan line) should have
        -   Image contains instructions on how to repeat the color in a particular row
    -   When a color is encountered that isn’t in the first column (the apple in this case), the instructions would list the colors for each non-repeated pixel
    -   This uses less bits but makes the original information recoverable
-   Lossy compression
    
    ![sunflower1](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/notes/3/sunflower1.png)
    
-   This is a .jpg photograph that is somewhat compressed, but not easy to tell
-   Let’s say we want to compress this image further so that we can share it without going over a social media platform’s limit
-   It contains more complicated patterns of colors, so let’s try a lossy compression resulting in the following:
    
    ![sunflower2](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/notes/3/sunflower2.png)
    
-   Lossy compression means that I won’t be able to get that original image back
    -   The compression throws away bits of information
        -   “Does the sky really need this many shades of blue?”
        -   “Does this leaf really need this many shades of green”
            -   Replaces bits with only a few colors giving an approximation
            -   I will not be able to know how clear the sky used to be from this information

## [Image File Formats](https://video.cs50.net/cscie1a/2017/fall/lectures/multimedia?t=23m21s)

-   BMP
    -   Originally used by Windows
    -   Not super common these days
-   GIF
    -   Low quality images
        -   Only supports 8-bit color
    -   Often used for memes
        -   Can be animated
        -   Like a video file with only a few images
            
            ![nyan](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/notes/3/nyan.gif)
            
-   JPEG
    -   Supports 24-bit color
    -   Losslessly compresses
        -   Can minimize amount of compression to create high quality photos
-   PNG
    -   High quality graphics
    -   Supports 24-bit color
-   All these formats ultimately have an limited amount of information
    -   Ultimate just store pixels and colors of when the image was taken

## [“Enhance”](https://video.cs50.net/cscie1a/2017/fall/lectures/multimedia?t=27m0s)

-   Common for popular culture abuses of what it means to be a multimedia format
    -   “Enhancing” means to make an image as clear as possible not matter what format it was saved in
-   [David shows a clip of characters “enhancing” an image](https://video.cs50.net/cscie1a/2017/fall/lectures/multimedia?t=27m30s)
    -   The characters zoom into a pixelated frame of a video and somehow clear it up to see a reflection
        -   Video is just a whole bunch of images being shown to us quickly (24 frames per second, etc.)
    -   The pixelated image only contains information for those pixels
        -   There is no way to obtain a clear image unless the original image was already at a high resolution
-   [David contrasts this with an aware clip of Futurama](https://video.cs50.net/cscie1a/2017/fall/lectures/multimedia?t=30m5s)

## [Video Compression](https://video.cs50.net/cscie1a/2017/fall/lectures/multimedia?t=30m21s)

-   You can think of a video format as similar to a flip book
-   Video formats are just a bunch of images shown quickly in succession to create the illusion of motion
    -   Not necessarily all information stored as png, jpg, gif, or even images
    -   Algorithms and mathematics can help go from one frame to another
-   Opportunities for compression
    -   Can leverage same image compression techniques for each frame (intra-frame coding)
    -   Background of multiple frames can contain redundant information
        
        ![interframe](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/notes/3/interframe.png)
        
    -   Compare current frame and next frame of video and determine what has changed
        -   Store these differences
        -   Key frames store a snapshot of time to remember what the video looks like
        -   In each subsequent frame remember what has changed
            -   Using algorithms and math, background is drawn
        -   Key frames are stored multiple times to guarantee that frames can be recovered

## [Video File Formats](https://video.cs50.net/cscie1a/2017/fall/lectures/multimedia?t=34m16s)

-   In the world of video, there are more solutions on how to store information
-   Video file formats are containers
    -   Containers are digital container in which you can put multiple types of data
    -   Can include a video track, audio track, a secondary audio track (for different languages), closed captions, …
-   AVI
    -   Commonly used in Windows
-   DivX
-   Matroska
    -   Open source container meant to be more versatile
-   MP4
    -   Pretty much universal in all browsers
-   QuickTime
    -   Commonly used in MacOS
-   Codecs
    -   Ways of storing and encoding information
    -   For video:
        -   H.264
        -   MPEG-4 Part-2
        -   …
    -   For audio:
        -   Can be stand alone files or tracks in a container!
        -   AAC
        -   MP3
        -   …

## [3D Video](https://video.cs50.net/cscie1a/2017/fall/lectures/multimedia?t=36m45s)

-   Increasingly, 3D formats are becoming more common
    
    ![Sanders](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/notes/3/sanders.png)
    
    -   This is a 360 degree image of Sanders Theatre
        -   A spherical image
        -   Looks distorted in 2D
        -   Like flattening a globe
-   Images can contain metadata
    -   Information that viewers can’t see
    -   Tells programs, applications, and browsers how to display the image
-   With sensors on a headset, users can experience virtual reality
    
    ![VR](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/notes/3/vr.png)
    
-   More file formats are still on the horizon, but ultimately all of them boil down to storing 0s and 1s and why!
