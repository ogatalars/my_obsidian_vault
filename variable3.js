const birthday = "18.04.1982";

const age = someCode(birthday);
// Here we have a constant birthday for the date, and also the age constant.

// The age is calculated from birthday using someCode(), which means a function call that we didn’t explain yet (we will soon!), but the details don’t matter here, the point is that age is calculated somehow based on the birthday.

// Would it be right to use upper case for birthday? For age? Or even for both?

// We generally use upper case for constants that are “hard-coded”. Or, in other words, when the value is known prior to execution and directly written into the code.

// In this code, birthday is exactly like that. So we could use the upper case for it.

// In contrast, age is evaluated in run-time. Today we have one age, a year after we’ll have another one. It is constant in a sense that it does not change through the code execution. But it is a bit “less of a constant” than birthday: it is calculated, so we should keep the lower case for it.
