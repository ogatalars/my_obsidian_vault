  ![Full Stack Development with MongoDB, Java, and React](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w2000/2023/01/fullstack.png)

Full stack web developers must be familiar with a wide variety of technologies and programming languages.

We just published a video course in the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that is designed to introduce students to building full stack applications using MongoDB, Java, Spring Boot, and React. The course will guide students through the process of developing a movie review application that utilizes a separation of concerns between the client and server code.

Farhan Hasin Chowdhury teaches the backend section of this course and Gavin Lon teaches the frontend section. Both these instructors are very experienced developers and have created many popular courses.

The course starts off with the JDK and IntelliJ IDEA Installation, to ensure that students have the necessary tools to begin development. Next, students will learn how to set up a MongoDB Atlas cluster and connect it to the application.

The course will then proceed with the initialization of the project and an overview of the project structure. Students will learn how to run the project and write the first endpoint. After that, students will learn how to configure the database and install additional dependencies, such as setting up environment variables.

Next, students will learn how to create endpoints for movies and reviews, and how to test the backend functionality. The backend section of the course will conclude with a discussion on best practices for developing and deploying the application.

The frontend section of the course will begin with an introduction to React, including the process of creating a React project, installing necessary npm packages, and configuring Axios. Students will learn how to get movie data from the MongoDB database, set up routes, and create components such as the home page, a hero component, and a header component.

Additionally, students will learn how to create a display for movie data on Material-UI Carousel, a Trailer component with react-player, and a reviews functionality. The course will wrap up with a discussion on best practices for developing and deploying the frontend of the application.

By the end of the course, students will have a solid understanding of how to build a full stack application using MongoDB, Java, Spring Boot, and React. Students will be able to use the knowledge gained to create their own applications that utilize a separation of concerns between the client and server code, and can evolve in parallel and independently from one another.
